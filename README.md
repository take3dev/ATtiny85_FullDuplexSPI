# attiny85_full-duplex-spi

Follow the development of an ATtiny85 SPI driver at [take3dev.com](take3dev.com)

## About this repository

In this series I am building a full-duplex buffered SPI driver for the ATtiny85 step by step. Each article will have an associated major version tag in the master branch.
Minor versions indicate fixes and edits that don't add features beyond the scope of the associated article. For instance, if you are here for part 3 of the series,
navigate to the most recent tag in the v3.x family. 

## How to use this codebase

In an effort to keep this repository light-weight, I am only uploading relevant code and reference documentation without project or build files. If you are following along
directly with the articles on [take3dev.com](take3dev.com) then you already have an Atmel Studio solution under development and can cross-reference your code with the files
in this repository. If you have come from another part of the internet, welcome and use the files within as you see fit for your needs.
